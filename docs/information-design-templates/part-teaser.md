# Teaser

Teasers are typically shown in [lists](part-list.md) on the start, category-, tag, contributor- or brand pages in order to internally promote content. Teasers can also be shown inline in content areas or in the recirculation section below content items.

## Teaser Content

All [content items](../data-models/content-item.md) on the platform comes with a teaser that can promote it in different ways. A teaser may have [specific teaser data](../data-models/content-item.md#teaser-data) or the platform will default to the content item title, image etc. 

## Teaser Presentation

Teasers will display information differently depending on: 
* What type of content it promotes (defined by its [content variant](../data-models/content-item.html#content-variants) and [content type](../data-models/content-item.html))
* The context it is presented in (see [containers](part-container.md) and [lists](part-list.md))
* [Content Item Display Preferences](../configuration/#content-item-display-preferences) 

## Internal Ad

Internal Ads are used throughout the site for the purpose of informing users about current offers, events etc. An internal ad is simply a teaser for a static page.
