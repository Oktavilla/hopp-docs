# Curated Content

Curated Content Management is the platform tools used in the editorial craft of promoting content on start pages and in recirculation.

## Curated Content Lists

A Curated Content List has a name and an approximate break off limit. The break off gives the editor a hint of how many teasers will be presented. The actual number of teasers presented can be affected by one or several positions being taken by ads, service Teasers or other Teasers. See the [configuration options for Curated Pages](../configuration/curated-content-list.md) for more info on that.
