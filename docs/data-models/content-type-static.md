# Static (Content Type)

A static page is similar to other types of content and is defined as a content type (with possible variants). Static Content differs from other types of content in the following ways:

* It can not have metadata relations
* It can not be published in the category tree
* It will not show up in automated lists

## Fields

{% include fields-table.md parent_definition="content-item-fields" definition="content-type-static-fields" %}

\* Basic [Content Item field](content-item.md#fields)

## Promotion & Indexing Data

{% include fields-table.md parent_definition="promotion-fields" %}

* Static pages have the same [“Promotion & Indexing Data”](content-item.md#promotion--indexing-data) as other content types.

## Content Variants

There are currently *no* variants of static pages.
