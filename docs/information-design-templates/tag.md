# Tag Page

There is one page for each Tag. The content of a tag page is determined by its [type](../data-models/tag.md).

* If a tag has children the tag page will feature a navigation allowing the user to drill down.
* A tag page will always list all content items placed in or below it (latest first).

For specific needs a standard tag page can be “replaced” by a
[curated tag page](tag-curated.md).
