# Tag

Tags are used to describe content but are also content in its own regard. There are a few tag types native to the platform. All these tag types have separate schemas and information design templates that define what type of content they may have and how they are displayed on articles, in lists and as a page. Every product will have a set of tag groups defined by the product configuration. A tag group can only contain tags of a specific type.
