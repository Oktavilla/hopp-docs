# Curated Content Layout

{% include wip.md %}

A Curated Content Layout consists of an ordered list of containers. Each container has a finite number of positions. Each position have a content source and an optional fallback source. A source can either be a Curated Content List (found by key), an Ad Position or a Service Teaser.
