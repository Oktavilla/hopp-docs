# Teaser

Teasers are typically shown on the start page, in top lists and on category-, tag, contributor- and brand pages in order to internally promote content. Teasers can also be shown inline in content areas or in the recirculation section below content items.

All content items in the platform comes with a teaser that can promote it in different ways. A teaser may have specific teaser data or the platform will default to the content items title, image etc. Teasers will display different information depending on what type of content it promotes (defined by its content variant and type) and the context it is presented in (see containers and lists). 

Internal Ads are used throughout the site for the purpose of informing users about current offers, events etc. An internal ad is simply a teaser for a static page.
