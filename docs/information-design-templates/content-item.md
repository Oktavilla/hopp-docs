# Content Item Page

There is one page for each Article, Video etc. Exactly what fields and data that is available is defined by the [Content Type Schema]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/data-models/content-item.md %}).

Besides the actual specific content defined in the content item this page may also have recirculation, internal ads and product services teasers (like subscriptions).

The Information Design Templates also come with dedicated social media tags that guarantees great presentation on social media platforms. The content of these tags may have been specifically defined or they will default to the available content item data. 

The Information Design Templates are also pre optimised for great visibility in search engines through speed and industry standard use of meta data and micro formats.
