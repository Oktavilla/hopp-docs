# Filtered Category Page

A standard section page can be “replaced” with a page that allows content filtering. In this case navigation works like so:

* Any sub sections will be shown as “filter options”. Users will not “drill down” but will stay on the section page (the path will remain the same). The article list will be filtered to only contain those in the selected sub section(s).
* Additionally it’s also possible to allow filtering on tags by selecting one or several filterable Tag Groups.
* Users may combine filter options. Filter options within a group (sub sections list or Tag Variant tags) combines with an OR clause. Groups are then combined with AND. This means you are able to create filter combinations like (Culture/Lifestyle OR Outdoors/Nature) AND (Sweden OR Norway).
