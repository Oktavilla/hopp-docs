# Ad

The platform has these ad positions:

1. Panorama below site head.
2. Panorama tag page below intro
3. In article (injected after the second block in article body unless paywall is shown)

These ad positions will not render any ads unless the [product is configured to do so](../configuration/ad-positions).
