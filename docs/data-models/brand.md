# Brand

A brand is a type of meta content that can be used to structure branded content. A brand has a name, a logo and a description. You will be able to relate content items, tags and categories to a brand and a brand will have its own page listing all related content.

As long as a content item isnâ€™t explicitly related to a brand it may inherit brand information from its category or tags. If that means an article ends up with several sponsors they will all be shown.
