# Service Teasers

A service teaser is a static teaser for a site function, i.e a subscription. 
It is rendered by one of the [available templates](../information-design-templates/components-and-containers-service-teaser.md#service-teaser-templates).
For each Service Teaser that should exist you need to specify:

{% include fields-table.md definition="configuration-service-teaser" %}
