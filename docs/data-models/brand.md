# Brand

A brand is a type of meta content that can be used to structure branded content. A brand has a name, a logo and a description. You will be able to relate [content items](content-item.md), [tags](tag.md) and [categories](category.md) to a brand and a brand will have [its own page](../information-design-templates/brand.md) listing all related content.
