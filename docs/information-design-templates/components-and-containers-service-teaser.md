# Service Teaser

A Service Teaser is used to promote functions or services on the platform such as subscribe etc. There are [a few positions](../field-types/field-type-page-position.md) where these can be shown. These service teaser positions will not render anything unless the product is [configured to do so](../configuration/service-teaser-positions).

## Service Teaser Templates

There's currently two types of service teasers:

1. Product subscription offer
2. Newsletter subscription offer

A service teaser should be configured to use one of these.
