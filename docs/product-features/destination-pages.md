# Destination Pages & Recirculation

## Destination Pages

Destination Pages (sometimes called start pages and sub start pages) have one primary job. That is to promote the most relevant content to visitors. This is done through setting up specific "content mixes" for each page. The mixes will in turn display teasers from a set of lists that are either manually or automatically curated (albeit through a set of editorially determined rules). For a maximum of flexibility different destination pages can have different layouts and consist of different sections and containers, but content lists can be shared between them regardless. So, no need to update a list of "featured opinion pieces", for example, more than once even though it's displayed on several pages.

## Recirculation

We've all heard that "the article is the new start page"... Therefore recirculaton works pretty much similar to Destination Pages. Recirculation can either be automated or editorially controlled. Or even a combination thereof. It's possible to define different Recirculation Content Mixes for different Categories and it's possible to place recirculation both beneath the article and inline.
