# Continuous Scroll Reading Experience

Any Container in a [Curated Content](destination-pages.md) Layout can be [configured](../configuration/curated-content-layout.md#container) to serve its content in a Continuous Scroll mode.

This mode enables users to seamlessly scroll through your content using any Content Item as a starting point. The mode is supported by both manually and automatically curated content lists and by filtering out any Content Items already read by the user the platform also provides a basic but effective personalisation.
