# Byline Image

There are different types of byline images. For [Contributor](../data-models/contributor.md) Feature Byline Images the platform will assume "Masked Half Body". For normal Byline Images the platform will assume "Avatar".

## "Avatar"  
An "avatar" should be square and will normally show the face of the contributor.

## "Masked Half Body"
A "masked half body" image should also be square but it must also have a transparent background. It should show the torso and go all the way to the edge in the bottom.
