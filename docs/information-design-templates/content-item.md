# Content Item Page

There is one template for each [Content Variant](../data-models/content-item.md#content-variants). Exactly what fields and data that is available is defined by the [Content Type Schema](../data-models/content-item.md).

Besides content this page may also feature recirculation, [display ads](../data-models/part-ad.md), internal ads (static page teasers) and product services teasers (e.g for subscriptions).

## Social Media Promotion

The Content Item Templates come with dedicated social media tags that guarantees great presentation on social media platforms. 

The content of these tags may have been [specifically defined](../data-models/content-item.md#social-media-promotion-data) or they will default to the available [content item](../data-models/content-item.md) data. 

## Search Engine Promotion

The Information Design Templates are pre optimised for great visibility in search engines through speed and industry standard use of meta data and micro formats. 

## Sponsorship

When a content item has a relationship to a [brand](../data-models/brand.md) that is called a sponsorship. There are two kinds:
* A content item may be explicitly related to a brand through its meta data.
* A content iten may inherit brand information from its [category](../data-models/category.md) or [tags](../data-models/tag.md).

If a content item ends up with several sponsors they will all be shown. 

## Recirculation

TBD
