# Tag Groups

This configuration list determines what [Tag Groups](../data-models/tag-group.md) should be available in the product. The actual content of the Tag Groups (as defined in the [data model](../data-models/tag-group.md)) are editable in the CMS. 

For each Tag Group that should exist you need to specify:
{% include fields-table.md definition="configuration-tag-group-fields" %}
