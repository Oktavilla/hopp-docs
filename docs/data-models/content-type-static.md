# Static (Content Type)

A static page is similar to other types of content and is defined as a content type (with possible variants). Static Content differs from other types of content in the following ways:

* It can not have metadata relations
* It can not be published in the category tree
* It will not show up in automated lists

## Possible fields

Static pages share the [same basic fields](content-item.md) and [“teaser data”](content-item.md#teaser-data) as other content types.

| Content Field                                   | Required |
|:------------------------------------------------|:---------|
| [Content Blocks](content-blocks.md) (any)       | No       |
